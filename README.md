1. Obtain Google API Credentials:
   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a project and enable the desired API (e.g., Google Trends API).
   - Generate API credentials (OAuth 2.0 or API key) and download the credentials file.

2. Configure API Access in Power BI:
   - In Power BI, use the API credentials to connect to the Google API.
   - Use the "Get Data" feature to pull data from the web, providing the relevant endpoint for the Google API.
   - For example, for Google Trends, use the Trends endpoint and query the specific data you want to analyze.

3. File Overview:
   - The `Google_Trends.pbix` file contains visualizations that track trends data fetched from Google API.
   - It includes [specific features] such as [summary of key visualizations or insights].

4. Customization:
   - Modify the query parameters in the Power Query Editor to pull data for different time ranges, regions, or topics.
   - Adapt the visuals or create new ones as per your analysis needs.

5. Deployment:
   - After customizing the report, it can be published to the Power BI service for collaborative use.

# Notes:
- Ensure that the API limits and quotas are respected to avoid errors while retrieving data.
- Google API calls may require a paid subscription depending on the usage level.



You can adjust the specifics based on the exact API you're using and the workflow followed in your Power BI file. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or further details!
